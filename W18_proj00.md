(a) Alva is a single-player platformer in which the player controls a robot, named Alva, navigating each level by fliiping switches and interacting with obstacles.

(b)
- As a player, I should be able to properly control Alva so that the in-game character does everything that I want it to.
- As a player, I should be able to flp switches to create changes in the game environment.
- As a player, I should be able to move boxes to create changes in the game environment, allowing for new movement choices.
- As a game, I should display multiple level choices when the game starts so the player can pick which level they want to play.

(c) 
In its current state, the game runs. Upon passing the command line argument "ant run", the game pops up in a new window, displaying the level select screen. Once a level is selected, the game loads the world, and the player can begin controlling Alva, until the player quits the game (pressing "Enter" returns to level select screen, where the game can be quit using the "Quit" button"

(d)
- As a player, I should be able to beat each level in some way
- As a game, I should display the instructions so the player knows what to do. 
- As a player, I should be able to listen to music while I am playing, and sound effects in general.

(e)
Currently, the Readme.md is in good shape. Although it is relatively short, it also is a relatyively small project and has a lot of room to grow. The Readme doesn't say the complete instructions (pressing "Enter" to return to level select, for example), but otherwise it says most everything needed to know to begin working on the repo. That being said, it would be really helpful if more actual help was givin in the Readme for understanding the way the program runs (ie, which classes handle which parts, where and when.)

(f)
The build file is almost complete and well-factored, although still based in ant. One thing that is needed are the target descriptions. Although the targets are primarily self explanatory, a brief phrase could be included in each to better describe it. 

(g)
Currently in the stated issues, there are enough to earn 1000 points (there are about 2600 current points up for grabs). Out of those issues, about a third are large, big ticket issues (changing the physics engine, adding a level editor GUI, etc). the rest range from small (50pts) to medium (150-200 pts)
